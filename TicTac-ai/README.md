# Tic-Tac-Toe AI (Unbeatable)

This is a console-based implementation of the classic **Tic-Tac-Toe** game where you play against an **unbeatable AI**. The AI uses the **Minimax algorithm with Alpha-Beta Pruning** to always make the optimal move.

## 🎯 Features

- Human vs AI gameplay
- AI is unbeatable using game theory logic
- Clean console UI
- Easy-to-read code, great for learning Minimax

## 🧠 How It Works

The AI evaluates all possible future moves using the Minimax algorithm and prunes unnecessary paths with Alpha-Beta pruning to improve performance. This ensures the best possible move is always selected.

## 🕹️ How to Play

1. Clone or download this repository.
2. Run the script using Python 3:

   ```bash
   python tic_tac_toe_ai.py

## 💡Example

Welcome to Tic-Tac-Toe!
Do you want to go first? (y/n): y

|   |   |   |
|   |   |   |
|   |   |   |

Enter your move (row col): 0 0

| X |   |   |
|   |   |   |
|   |   |   |

AI's Turn:

| X |   |   |
|   | O |   |
|   |   |   |

## 🧠Learning Goals
- Understand turn-based game logic

- Learn and implement Minimax with Alpha-Beta pruning

- Apply decision trees and evaluation functions in games
